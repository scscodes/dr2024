Use the AWS wizard to build a new model. It will prompt you for parameters and the reward function logic.  

Shouldn't need any fancy imports. Start small and simple.  
Use helper functions to keep things organized and logically separate.

# ... save or use helper functions
- CRUD them in `functions.py`
- Copy/paste to/from your model reward function 

# ... save a new model
- New reward function saved in `model_rewards`
- Nice-to-have naming convention: `re-<algorithm>-<whatever you want>`
  - `<name>.py` or `<name>.ipynb`

# ... analyze logs
- [log guru repo](https://github.com/aws-deepracer-community/deepracer-log-guru?tab=readme-ov-file)
  - suggested repo from documentation
  - requires python 3.9.*
